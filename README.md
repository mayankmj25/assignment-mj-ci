Downsampling Algorithm : The downsampling function provided in out code snippet is an example of a basic downsampling technique. It does not adhere to a specific, named downsampling algorithm like "Largest Triangle Three Buckets" (LTTB) or "Douglas-Peucker." Instead, it implements a simple and straightforward approach often referred to as "Sampling Every Nth Point" or "Uniform Sampling."
